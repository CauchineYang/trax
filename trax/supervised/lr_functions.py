"""Learning rate schedules as functions of time (step number).

This is work in progress, intertwined with ongoing changes in supervised
training and optimizers. When complete, the learning rate schedules in this
file are intended to replace the prior ones in trax/lr_schedules.py. The
current package location/name (trax/supervised/lr_functions.py) is
correspondingly temporary.

  The warm-up, if present, is based on the line connecting points (0, 0) and
  (body_start, body_value). The tail, if defined, is a function from time to
  learning rate that is used for all training steps from tail_start on.
